Django-Oscar Demo
------------------

**NOTE**: This is a copy of the old demo site from the Django Oscar repository. See https://github.com/django-oscar/django-oscar/pull/1911 or more information.


This is intended to show off some of Oscar's features, such as:

* Customising core models
* Overriding templates and CSS: changing the site appearance
* Integrating with some of Oscar's extensions

Most of this is still a work-in-progress.
